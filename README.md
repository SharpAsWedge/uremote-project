## Introduction
This is a repository for the Mobile Phone Reuse Project called "U-Remote" being developed by BEI students (more details below) enforced by DoECE Pulchowk Campus for the fifth semester. The project aims to be able to use the IR Blaster that is pre-supplied with certain phone models, which can be used to control different home appliances without having to go through the tiresome process of searching for the actual remote for the device.
